# Self Evaluation

## How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
- It definitely varies depending on the method. Some built in methods are very intuitive or dont require an argument (like .length, for example), so its pretty easy to wrap my head aroud its use-cases. BUT THEN I'll look through the ruby docs and see methods like .scrub()/.scrub!() and say to myself "yeah, that ones going to take me quite some research..."

## How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
- I feel pretty good about writing simple methods, and thanks to Cydnee, I'm looking forward to Classes in Mod 1 because I will have more of a whole picture to their proper uses. I'm a big picture thinker, so it can get pretty difficult to wrap my head around the more basic concepts without a good general idea about the "why." I feel that simply having more time to practice, read and watch videos will lead to more comfort.

## What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
- I'm still not entirely clear about the overall concept of how storing a return value works, and how "where it's stored" is manipulated.
~~~ruby
def add(num1, num2)
  num1 + num2 # <= return value "storage area"?
end

sum1 = add(2, 3)
sum2 = add(7, 9)

puts sum1
puts sum2
~~~
